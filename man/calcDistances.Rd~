\title{
  Calculate Distances Between Time Series
}

\description{
  This is an experimental function to calculate distances between time series.
}
\usage{
  calcDistances(X, method="C", nodes=20)
}

\arguments{
  \item{X}{Matrix with time series values.}
  \item{method}{Method  of choice to calculate the distance.}
  \item{nodes}{Number of splines for the spline-based approach.}
}

\details{
 This is an early attempt to implement a distance measure for time series clustering. It has not yet been used in
 productive code yet and hence should be used carefully.

 Currently there are two different methods available, the default is \code{method="C"}. The alternative is \code{"spline"},
 what is a spline based approach.

 The matrix \code{X} contains the individuals in the rows and the columns represent the time points. 
 
 As this is developing code, we do not give further information, yet, but include the function in the package for testing
 and distribution purposes.   

}
\value{
 A matrix with pairwise distances.
